Template for basic front-end app using GulpJS, sass, Autoprefixer, BrowserSync and Concat.


## System Preparation

To use this starter project, you'll need the following things installed on your machine.

2. [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) - use the installer.
3. [GulpJS](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) - `$ npm install -g gulp` (mac users may need sudo)

2. Inside the directory, run `npm install`.
